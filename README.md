# Java lottie converter

~~A library that I created to render lottie files from discord to GIFs.
Please do not look at the source code, I am too embarrassed XD~~

~~I will publish this library when completed so have fun with it when you can.~~

In the end, i decided to just use https://github.com/sot-tech/LottieConverter
